# Summary
This is the notebook to analyze the Starbucks dataset. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Our goal for this project is to predict if the offer will be completed or not.

# Installation
You will need to install the following libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
- pandas
- pickle

# Run
For running the code, you can simply follow the steps in the notebook (_Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb_). 
The datasets (csv file) is in the _data_ folder.


# Note
This project is based on the Udacity course.
